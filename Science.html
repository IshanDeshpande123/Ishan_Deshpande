     <h1>Science Project topic - Study India's Contributation to Satellite Technology</h1>



<h2>India's contribution to satellite technology through GSAT(Geosynchronous satellite).</h2>
<p>The GSAT-N2 satellite's multi-beam architecture allows for frequency reuse, greatly improving system throughput and<br> boosting India's communication capabilities. The satellite will also support India's Smart Cities initiative and improve<br> broadband services.</p>
<h3>Satellites includes:</h3>

<h4>GSAT-15</h4>
<p>This high power satellite carries a GPS aided GEO augmented Navigation (GAGAN) payload and a Ku-band beacon<br>

          It is the third satellite to carry the GAGAN payload.</p>
 
<h4>GSAT - 20
</h4>

           <p> GSAT 20 also know as CMS-03 or GSAT-N2, this satellites is india's most advanced communication satellite to data.</p>

<h2>What is the main purpose of the GSAT satellite?</h2>
           
<p> the GSAT satellite are india's indigenously developement  communications satellites used for digital  audio data and 
           video.<br> broadcasting for both military and civilian users. As of november 2018,  19 GSAT satellite of ISRO (Indian satellite resarch organisation )<br>
          have been launched  out of which 15 satellites are currently in service.
<h2>How GSAT satellites help in weather pridiction?</h2>
<p>The geostationary satellite (GSAT),help improve weather predication by providing data about the Earth's atmospheres,ocean and land surfaces.
   <h4>   visible - light images</h4>

<p>These images are easy to see and can show clouds, lakes, forests, mountains, snow, ice, fires and pollution.
<h4>Imaging during severe weather </h4>
<p>GSAT can be commanded to take images every 5-15 minutes during severe weather outbreaks.</p>

<h2>How GSAT satellites help with navigation?</h2>

<p>GSAT satellites help with navigation through the satellite based augmentation system (SBAS) and the GPS aided Geo augmented navigation (GAGAN) payload.
<p>GSAT satellites navigation recievers use signals from multiple satellites to reduce errors. they use techniques like Kalman filtering to combine the data into a single 
          estimate for position,time etc.</p>
